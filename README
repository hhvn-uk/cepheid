Concessions
===========

Aurora and this game have both made many concessions when it comes to physics
and astronomy in order to make something playable. Some of them are listed here
(excluding fictional tech like jump points).

Physics:
 - The movement of ships solely relies on their max speed: there is no
   acceleration, nor gravitational effect.

Astronomy:
 - Retrograde orbits are not modelled. (Where they exist in the solar system:
   eg, Triton and Phoebe, they are modelled as prograde orbits).
 - All system bodies are assumed to be spherical.
 - All oribts (excluding comets) are assumed to be spherical.
 - Comets "orbit" in a straight line extending outward from the centre of a
   star.
